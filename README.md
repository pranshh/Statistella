## Problem Statement

In the Statistella Challenge, participants received an Excel/CSV file containing detailed information about goods purchased by customers and corresponding sales transactions. The task entailed a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, drawing meaningful inferences to answer a set of given questions.

## Project Overview

This repository contains my solutions and findings for the Statistella Analytics Competition. The main tasks I focused on were:

1. **Feature Analysis**: I examined the dataset, paying close attention to features such as states, customer names, order timestamps, quantities, discounts, and profits.

2. **Pattern Recognition**: I utilized Data Analytics techniques to discern patterns within the dataset. I uncovered correlations, dependencies, and hidden dynamics that contribute to the sales outcomes.

The final result of this project is an impactful PowerBI dashboard that addresses crucial facets of the business and provides meaningful insights into the data.
